# SimpleDHT
This project involves designing a simple distributed key-vaalue storage based on Chord. It is a simplified version of Chord and does not need to implement finger tables and finger-based routing; neither does it handle node leaves/failure. The distributed hash table (DHT) is built on top of the android content provider.
